# nemChatMobile
> An implementation of the nemChat wrapper for the NEM blockchain.

**WARNING** I've stopped working on this project long ago. It was buggy and incomplete.

## Motivation
I wanted to put into practice and create a "real product" using the blockchain technology.

## Build notes
You can check the package.json file to see which script to use for building the app. Note that it is based on the https://github.com/eliabiraschi/nemChat classes that you have to clone separately and link with NPM manually.
You will also need to add the OnsenUI lib.
